## Detailed Methodology
-- Implementation of Core Features
The program collects user input for name, grade level, student status, allowance, and expenses.

The budget is calculated using:
difference = allowance - expenses

A decision control structure determines the result:

if difference > 0
elif difference == 0
else


## Backend–Frontend Communication
-- Not applicable. This project is a standalone console-based Python application.


## Key Design Decisions
-- Modular structure for clarity
Simple user interface via terminal
Clear financial reporting
Prevention of invalid input errors
